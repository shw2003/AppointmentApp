## Lessons Learned

This project was very interesting for me because in this project I can implement my own thinking and creativity. I always try to learn something new and to explore extra features that I don't know. In this project, I use Stripe payment system, react-hook-form, react-day-picker, react-multi-carousel etc. Which is very interesting and attractive. I used JWT(JSON Web Token) in this project. Which is more stale security for my website.


## Features

- Light/dark mode toggle
- Dynamic route facility, good UI/UX experience .
- Appointments booking facilities.
- Attractive dashboard that allows you to manage your appointments.
- Appointments fee payment system with stripe and cancellation.
- Response web application which allows you to use all cross platforms.

#### Is it team project?

```bash
  No. It's a single project. I have created this website.
```

#### Is it a Production label website?

```bash
  I think it's not a production label website. Because a production label website need some extra features and ability to get best output. But there are not available this ability.
```
